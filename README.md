# Web-Dev
## This repo contains a website I made for a UID Project

The current webpage is made using Bootstrap.

It has a form and a game as well( Although the game is quite small and simple).
The wallpaper has been changed to fit in the any screen resolution and the website now works on most if not for all screen resolution.
The wallpapers also change for phone and other bigger screen resolution.

The website is currently hosted [here](https://akashharikumar.netlify.app)
